# A71CH Secure Element Demo

This is a demonstration made for a public workshop in 2019 in collaboration with NXP. The demonstration shows the A71CH Secure Element of NXP in combination with Toradex's Colibri iMX6ULL and Torizon. It includes a secure client - server communication, with authentication of the client, for a secure and integer file download. The given use case shows how a docker container can be exchanged with a file from a server, using the implemented secure file download. With this, one can go through different code segments in the demo code and see how the A71CH Secure Element can be used, either directly or with the provided OpenSSL engine.
